## Projects list in Data science
### 1- Avocado Price Prediction
#### Description
Using the Avocado dataset, we aim to build a machine-learning model to predict the average price of the Hass avocados based on location and variety, focusing on the Hass variety, which accounts for 95% of avocado consumption in the United States.

### 2- Increasing Yield and Production with Linear regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest
#### Description
The system utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the agricultural yield rate in this project. Python and the Jupiter Notebook interface are widely accepted programming languages for implementing innovative ideas in machine learning. By employing machine learning techniques such as Linear Regression, Random Forest regression, and Decision Tree regression, the project will generate forecasts for agricultural yield and production based on the provided dataset.

### 3- Energy Consumption Predictive Model for Bundoora Campus
#### Description
We are developing an Energy Consumption Predictive Model using regression modeling to improve energy efficiency and reduce operating costs. This model can predict numerical values by analyzing historical and real-time data, such as energy usage, weather conditions, gas and water consumption, and daily electricity usage. By identifying areas of excessive energy use and implementing energy-efficient measures, the model can help boost profitability.

### 4- What factors might impact students' academic performance?
#### Description
The data used in this project is a dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset is about student performance. The data is already preprocessed to prepare it for this project's primary goal, namely, to visualize the data. As we can see, the data has columns as follows: gender, age, Medu, Fedu, traveltime, Walc, health, and averagegrade. We display some statistical summaries of the numerical columns and the data output. describe() method. Before using the data, we need to clean it by dropping the unnecessary information drop (), checking missing values, and identifying outliers in the data. 

### 5- Hotel Booking Analysis, Process and analyze hotel booking data to identify trends, booking preferences, and cancellations
#### Description
Large-scale websites and platforms are continuously updated in real-time as computer networks develop, producing copious amounts of data. For a long time, the hotel has been collecting vital information from online user comments. Data from booking systems, such as consumer choices, cancellations, and other booking-related information, can provide insightful information about the travel and tourism sector. It is imperative to conduct an efficient analysis and pinpoint noteworthy patterns to utilize this data appropriately. When data is used correctly, many inherent biases are eliminated, giving hotel chains that understand data analysis and automation a significant competitive edge their decision-making. Digital information is used by hotel data analytics to help your hotel make better decisions.

### 6- Predicting Work Visa in the United States
#### Description
The project aims to develop a model that can predict a candidate's outcome based on their status, allowing them to determine where to apply and what their chances are of receiving a job offer.

### 7- Cleaning/Formatting Flat File Source. SAIPE School District Estimates for 2021/ Estimates for Every School District in the Nation 
#### Description
The dataset I used was the SAIPE School District Estimates for 2021/ Estimates for Every School District in the Nation. 
The Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates Program (SAIPE) estimates poverty for states, counties, and school districts, as well as 
median household income for states and counties. These projections are based on statistical models that combine population projections, 
ousehold surveys, administrative data, and results from the decennial census.

### 8- Connecting to an API/Pulling in the Data and Cleaning/Formatting
#### Description
API used: US Public School 
#### Description
My goal in working with this dataset was to clean the data, which involved several steps, such as converting strings to lower or proper case, identifying and addressing missing data, dealing with inconsistent values, finding outliers, identifying duplicates, and grouping data by state. During this process, I filled in missing data with the string 'not available' and removed outliers from the 'ft_teacher' column. I made these modifications to practice handling missing data and outliers as part of this project.

### 9- Recommender System
#### Description
We used collaborative filtering based on user-item interactions to build a basic movie recommender system with the small MovieLens dataset. Collaborative filtering is a widely used technique for creating recommendation systems that rely on past behavior, such as movie ratings, to provide suggestions.
